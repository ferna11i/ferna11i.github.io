          <p>With the current COVID crisis that dominates the world we must ensure to protect others as
		  well as ourselfs by wearing face masks appropriately whenever we step into an enclosed area. 
		  This is the second line of defence after receiving two doses of vaccinations.</p>
		  <p>This project deals with identifying if people in images have worn their face masks or not.
		  It also checks to see if the person is wearing the face mask incorrectly.</p>
